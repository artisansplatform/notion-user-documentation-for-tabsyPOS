## Delete Customer

To remove a customer, click the **Delete** icon beside it. The system will ask for confirmation before deleting the record to prevent accidental removals. 

However, please note that a **customer cannot be deleted** if they are **referenced in any existing sales transaction**. This restriction ensures data integrity and prevents loss of linked sales information. Once a customer is successfully deleted, the record cannot be recovered.
