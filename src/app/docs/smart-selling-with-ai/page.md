## Smart Selling with AI



**AI-Powered Cart Creation**


TabsyPOS offers an **AI-driven cart creation feature** that lets you add multiple products and assign customers in a single command.


For example, you can type or speak:

> "Pls add two Smartwatch for John Deo"

The system will automatically:

- Add the specified **products** with the requested **quantities** to the cart.
- Assign the **customer** to the cart.
- Update the **cart total** and display it instantly.

This feature simplifies billing during busy hours and reduces manual steps, allowing you to complete transactions quickly and accurately.

**AI Model Capabilities and Usage**


Tabsy POS allows you to use AI-powered search and **cart creation** to speed up your sales process. Using natural language commands in the search bar, you can add multiple products to the cart and assign customers in a single instruction.


**AI Usage Guidelines**


You can type commands in a natural, conversational way, for example:

- “Add 2 Smartwatches, 3 Wireless Headphones, 2 Laptops in the cart and customer name John Doe, number 9876543210”
- “Add 2 Smartwatches, 3 Wireless Headphones, 2 Laptops for John Doe”
- “For John Doe, add 2 Smartwatches, 3 Wireless Headphones, 2 Laptops in the cart”
- “Add 2 Smartwatches, 3 Wireless Headphones, 2 Laptops in the cart, and the customer number is 9876543210”
- “1 Smartphone, 2 Laptops, and 3 Smartwatches add to cart and customer name John Doe”
> These commands demonstrate how AI can understand product quantities, multiple items, and optional customer information.


**Important Notes and Limitations**

- AI commands currently support **adding multiple products and assigning a single customer** per cart.
- The system may **not understand complex or ambiguous instructions** outside the provided examples.
- Voice recognition for AI commands is **browser-based** and does not require any AI model.
- Always **verify the cart contents** after using AI commands to ensure accuracy.
- AI capabilities in TabsyPOS depend on the selected model. If you use the **Local Model**, all AI functions will continue to work even when your device is offline. However, if you choose the **OpenRouter Model**, an active internet connection is required since it relies on third-party online services.
