# **AI Model Capabilities and Usage**

## **
Important Notes and Limitations**

* AI commands currently support **adding multiple products and assigning a single customer** per cart.
* The system may **not understand complex or ambiguous instructions** outside the provided examples.
* Voice recognition for AI commands is **browser-based** and does not require any AI model.
* Always **verify the cart contents** after using AI commands to ensure accuracy.
* AI capabilities in TabsyPOS depend on the selected model. If you use the **Local Model**, all AI functions will continue to work even when your device is offline. However, if you choose the **OpenRouter Model**, an active internet connection is required since it relies on third-party online services.
