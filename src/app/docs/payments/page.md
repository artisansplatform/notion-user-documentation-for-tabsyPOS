# **Payments**

## **Payments**


- **Choose Payment Method**
At the time of checkout, you can select your preferred payment method — **Cash**, **Card**, or **Online**. If you change your mind, you can easily switch between payment methods or delete one before confirming the sale. This flexibility ensures accurate and hassle-free billing every time.
- **Partial Payments**
Our Browser POS also supports **partial payments**, allowing customers to pay using more than one method — for example, a combination of **Cash and Card**. Simply enter the amount received in cash, and the system will automatically calculate the remaining balance to be paid through the other selected method.
