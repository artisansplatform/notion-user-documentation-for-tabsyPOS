# Data 

## Data Import 



The **Data Import** feature allows you to **restore or update** your store data from previously exported files — ideal for recovering data, transferring between devices, or synchronising information.


You can import the following types of data:

- **Products:** Complete product catalogue with names and prices.
    > Note: When importing products, the system merges new data with existing records and displays conflicts if any item values differ.
- **Customers:** Full customer database, including contact details.
    > Note: When importing customers, the system merges data with existing records and shows conflicts if any values differ.
- **Sales, Sales Items, and Sales Payments:** Transactional data including sale details, items, and related payments.
    > Note: During import, existing records in the selected tables are automatically replaced with the imported data.
- **Receipt Settings and Other Settings:** Restores customised templates and store preferences such as **language**, **currency**, and **AI model configuration**.
