## Data Export



The **Data Export** feature allows you to **back up or migrate** your store data quickly and securely — without requiring cloud access or an active internet connection.


You can export the following types of data:

- **Products:** Complete product catalogue with names and prices.
- **Customers:** Full customer database, including contact details.
- **Sales:** Comprehensive transaction history for all completed sales.
- **Sales Items:** Item-level details for each transaction.
- **Sales Payments:** Payment information linked to each sale.
- **Receipt Settings:** Customised receipt header and footer templates.
- **Other Settings:** Store preferences such as **language**, **currency**, and **AI model configuration**.
> Tip: For enhanced data security, you can back up your exported files to Google Drive directly from this section, ensuring your store information is safely stored and easily restorable whenever needed.
