## Cart Management


- **Update Item Price & Quantity**
After adding items to the cart, you can easily modify their details. Click the **edit icon** beside an item to update its **price**, or adjust the **quantity** using the **plus (+)** and **minus (–)** buttons, or by **entering the desired number directly in the quantity input field**. All changes are applied instantly and reflected in the **cart total**.
- **Delete Item from Cart**
To remove a product, click the **delete icon** next to the item in the cart. The system will instantly update the cart total after deletion.
- **Audio Mode**

    You can use **Audio Mode** to add items to the cart one by one using **voice commands**. This feature allows hands-free operation, making it easier to process sales in busy store environments.
    

- **Add Items to Cart by Scanning Barcode**
You can use **Scan Mode** to add items to the cart by scanning product barcodes. Click on the **camera icon**, show the barcode in front of the camera, and the system will automatically detect and add the item to the cart.
- **Reset Price to Original**
If a product’s price has been manually changed in the cart, you can quickly revert it to its original listed price. Click the **Reset to Original** button on the edit cart popup, and the system will automatically restore the original product price as defined in the product list.
- **Clear Cart**
Use the **Clear Cart** option to remove all items from the current cart at once. The system will ask for confirmation before clearing to prevent accidental loss of data.
- **Assign Customer to Cart or Add a New One**

    You can assign a customer to the current cart by selecting an existing customer from the list or **creating a new one**. Once assigned, the customer’s information is linked to the cart, making it easier to track transactions and maintain accurate records.

- **Change Customer on the Same Cart**

    If you need to switch the customer during checkout, simply click **Change Customer** and select another one from the list. The products already added to the cart remain unchanged, ensuring a smooth transition without losing any sale details.
