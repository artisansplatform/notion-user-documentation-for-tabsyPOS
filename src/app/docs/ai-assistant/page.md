## AI Assistant



TabsyPOS offers **free AI assistance** to help streamline **cart management** with intelligent, AI-driven features.


> Note: Voice search is browser-based and does not depend on any AI model.

### **Free AI Assistance & Usage Limits**



TabsyPOS provides AI assistance for cart management that you can use **for free up to 100 AI requests**. This allows you to start using AI features instantly without any additional configuration.

If your usage exceeds the free limit, you can continue using AI features by configuring your own **OpenRouter API key** in the AI Model Settings. Once configured, all AI requests will be processed using your OpenRouter account.


### OpenRouter AI Model 



TabsyPOS supports the **OpenRouter AI model** for providing AI assistance across features such as cart management. When you configure your own **OpenRouter API key**, the system uses **free OpenRouter models**, allowing you to continue using AI features at no additional cost, subject to OpenRouter’s terms and usage limits.


> **Important:** Because OpenRouter is an online third-party integration, AI features will not work when **you are offline**.
