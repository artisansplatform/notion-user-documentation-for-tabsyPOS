## Receipt Customisation



Personalise your receipts by editing the **header** and **footer** text. You can include store information, contact details, or a thank-you message to customers.


You can also extract text from an image and use it as the **receipt header or footer**. Upload an image, and the system will automatically detect the text for you. Before saving, you can use the **Preview** option to review how the text will appear on the receipt. Make any changes if needed, then tap **Save** to apply it to your receipt layout.
