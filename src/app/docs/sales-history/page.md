# Sales Transactions

## Sales History



The **Sales History** section provides a complete record of all past transactions, helping you track sales performance and access important details whenever needed.


To view your transaction history, go to the **Sales History** tab. Each record displays essential information such as the **date of sale**, **customer name**, **products purchased**, and **payment details**.

At the top of the page, you’ll see three summary tabs — **Today’s Sales**, **This Month**, and **This Year** — which display the total number of transactions for each period. These tabs give you a quick snapshot of your store’s performance at a glance, without affecting or filtering the detailed transaction list below.


You can open any transaction to **review individual cart items** or **reprint receipts** whenever required. Even without an internet connection, all sales data remains safely stored on your device, ensuring uninterrupted access and reliability.
