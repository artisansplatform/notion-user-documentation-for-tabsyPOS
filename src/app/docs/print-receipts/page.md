## Print Receipts



After completing the payment, simply click **Print Receipt** to get a detailed invoice for the transaction. The printed receipt includes essential information such as **store and customer details**, **purchased items with their prices**, and a **summary of the total amount and payment details**.


Even if you are offline, TabsyPOS securely stores receipts locally on your device, allowing you to print them anytime without needing an internet connection.
