## Chat-Based Sales



TabsyPOS allows users to complete a full sale directly from the chat window.


You can create and complete a sale simply by entering the required details in chat - no need to navigate to the regular billing screen.


### How It Works

1. Open the chat window.
2. Enter:
    - Product name
    - Customer name
    - Payment method
3. Click **Checkout**.
4. Hit **Send**.

The sale will be processed instantly through chat.
