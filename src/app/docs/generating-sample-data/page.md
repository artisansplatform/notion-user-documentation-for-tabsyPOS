# Introduction

## **Generating Sample Data**



When you first open **TabsyPOS**, if your database is empty, you will see the following prompt on the **Home Page**:

> "Your database is empty. Would you like to generate demo data to try out the application features?
>
> Note: You can reset data from the Settings page."
>
>

Clicking **Generate Demo Data** will automatically generate **sample products, customers, and sales transactions**, allowing you to explore and test all features of the system.


This demo data is temporary and can be cleared anytime using the **Clear Data** option in the **Settings** menu.
