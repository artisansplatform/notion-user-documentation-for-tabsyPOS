## **AI Models**




Tabsy POS offers two AI model options that power **intelligent product search** and **AI-powered cart creation**.

> **Note:** Voice recognition is browser-based and does not rely on any AI model.

### **1. Local Model**


This is the **default AI model** configured in the system.


If you are using the Local Model, ensure that your device meets the following minimum configuration for smooth performance:

- **Device RAM:** ≥ 4 GB
- **Storage:** 500 MB free
>   
> **Note:**   
>   
> 1. Using a device with lower specifications may cause slow performance when using AI-powered functions.  
> 2. Because it operates locally, **AI features continue to work even when you are offline**, making it ideal for stores without consistent internet access.  
> 

### **2. OpenRouter Model**


This option allows you to use AI through **OpenRouter’s platform** by configuring your own **OpenRouter API Key.**


TabsyPOS uses **free OpenRouter models**, meaning you do **not need to pay anything** to use this feature.


>   
> **Important:** Since OpenRouter is a third-party online integration, **AI features will not work if you are offline**.  
> 

Follow the steps below to set up the OpenRouter API Key:

1. Go to [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Log in to your account.
3. Open your **Profile**.
4. Navigate to the **Keys** section.
5. Click **Create API Key**.
6. Enter a **Name** for your key.
7. Set **Credit Limit** (Recommended: **0**).
8. Leave **Reset Limit Every** as default.
9. Copy the generated key (Note: It will be shown **only once**).
10. In **Tabsy POS**, go to **Settings → AI Model**.
11. Click **OpenRouter API Key** and paste your key.

Your AI model setup is now complete and ready to use.
