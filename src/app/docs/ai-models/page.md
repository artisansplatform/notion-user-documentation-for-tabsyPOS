## **AI Models**

Tabsy POS offers two AI model options that power **intelligent product search** and **AI-powered cart creation**.

> **Note:** Voice recognition is browser-based and does not rely on any AI model.

**1. Local Model**

This is the **default AI model** configured in the system.

If you are using the Local Model, ensure that your device meets the following minimum configuration for smooth performance:

* **Device RAM:** ≥ 4 GB
* **Storage:** 500 MB free 
> **
Note:** 

1. Using a device with lower specifications may cause slow performance when using AI-powered functions.
2. Because it operates locally, **AI features continue to work even when you are offline**, making it ideal for stores without consistent internet access.



**2. OpenRouter Model**

This option allows you to use AI through **OpenRouter’s platform** by configuring your own **OpenRouter API Key.**

TabsyPOS uses **free OpenRouter models**, meaning you do **not need to pay anything** to use this feature.


> 
**Important:** Since OpenRouter is a third-party online integration, **AI features will not work if you are offline**.


Follow the steps below to set up the OpenRouter API Key:

1. Go to [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/)
1. Log in to your account.
1. Open your **Profile**.
1. Navigate to the **Keys** section.
1. Click **Create API Key**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your key.
1. Set **Credit Limit** (Recommended: **0**).
1. Leave **Reset Limit Every** as default.
1. Copy the generated key (Note: It will be shown **only once**).
1. In **Tabsy POS**, go to **Settings → AI Model**.
1. Click **OpenRouter API Key** and paste your key.
Your AI model setup is now complete and ready to use.
